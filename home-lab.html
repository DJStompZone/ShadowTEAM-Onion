        <h2>Advanced SSH Tunneling and Networking</h2>
        <p>
            The home lab network now leverages the ASUS RT-AX82U AX5400 Dual-Band WiFi 6 router for enhanced SSH tunneling and networking capabilities. Here's how the updated setup works:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>External SSH Connection:</strong> External SSH connections are directed to a high-numbered port on the main household router. The ASUS RT-AX82U, hardwired to the primary router, forwards these connections to the dedicated SSH server (Super Pi) within the home lab.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Tunneling:</strong> The ASUS RT-AX82U provides a robust and secure tunnel for SSH traffic. With advanced QoS and AiProtection Pro features, it ensures that SSH connections are prioritized and protected from external threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized Networking:</strong> All servers within the lab are connected to a 5-port TP-Link unmanaged switch, which is hardwired to the ASUS router. This setup minimizes latency and maximizes throughput, making remote access and server management seamless and efficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This updated network configuration offers a significant improvement over the previous Pi Router setup, providing higher speeds, enhanced security, and a more stable connection for all SSH and networking tasks within the lab.
