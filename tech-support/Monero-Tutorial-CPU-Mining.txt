how to install Linux: 

1. sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev -y

2. git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git

3. cd xmrig

4. mkdir build

5. cd build

6. cmake ..

7. make

8. chmod a+x xmrig

9. ./xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128 -u <Monero wallet address> -p <device-name>

10. Now on another device download manero wallet and make a wallet and remember to save your seed phrase. Once wallet is made go to the 'Account' tab and copy your wallet address. if you already have your wallet and wallet address move on to the next step.

11.gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128   this is a mining pool thats open and is fine to use
   you can change this with other mining pools if you wish


To make it a service so it runs anytime the computer starts up youll
need to make this file.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/miner.service

This is what you put in the miner.service

[Unit]
Description=XMRig Monero Miner

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/<user>/xmrig/build
ExecStart=/home/<user>/xmrig/build/xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128 -u <wallet address> -p <device-name>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


then 

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl enable miner.service

sudo systemctl start miner

sudo systemctl status miner


to mine in the build folder to test use these commands:


to mine max cpu thread

./xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128 -u <Monero wallet address> -p <device-name> --cpu-max-threads-hint
