[using tor as a proxy chain in debian based linux]

[configure tor as proxy chain]

first we need to edit the proxy chain config which in most cases will be found here>

- sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf

if it is not here you can use the locate command to find it>

- locate proxychains

once in the proxychains config file first and formost we need to set the proxy chain to dynamic
by uncommenting the #dynamic_chain > dynamic_chain and commenting the strict_chain > #strict_chain

Please make sure that proxy_dns is uncommented this is important.

Now scroll to the bottom of the config file and add this>

[Proxy List]
#add proxy here ...
#meanwhile
#deafults set to "tor"
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
socks5  127.0.0.1 9050

Please note the double space is correct between socks and the ip

save and exit file.


[installing and running tor]

you have to run tor as a service to enable the proxy chain usage

to install tor 

- sudo apt install tor

to start tor

- sudo service tor start

check to make sure it is working

- service tor status

[To use proxy chains]

In this example we will be using nmap, this is helpful to add another layer of security/ anonymity
to a scan, You can also use the proxy chains for other things, We are usung nmap to simplify use.

how to use

- proxychains nmap <command options>

to use with browser (firefox for example)

- proxychains firefox
